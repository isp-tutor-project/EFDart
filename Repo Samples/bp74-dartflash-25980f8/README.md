This library provides the Flash API build on top of open web standards (HTML5). Developers who build applications with Flash may have noticed that Flash isn't a popular choice anymore. Some of you probably think about a migration strategy from Flash to HTML5. 

What we try to achieve with dartflash:

* The library should be highly compatible with the Flash API.
* The programming language should be similar to ActionScript 3.

## Demo

This little game was developed with Flash and later ported to HTML5 in only 6 hours. The new HTML5 version runs with smooth 60fps, which is almost impossible to achieve with the Flash plugin!

## Dart programming language

JavaScript is the lingua franca of the Web. The problem with JavaScript is that it sucks. You may disagree but if you come from the ActionScript world (or C# and Java) you scratch your head and wonder. Maybe Google thought the same and started the Dart programming language project. This language fixes all the flaws of JavaScript and at the same time compiles to JavaScript to run your application on all modern browers.
